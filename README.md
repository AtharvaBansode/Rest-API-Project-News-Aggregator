# Rest-API-Project-News-
This News Aggregator is a web application built using Flask that curates and displays the latest news articles from various sources. The project utilizes Flask's render_template module to dynamically generate HTML pages that present the news content fetched via REST API calls. The requests library is used to interact with the News API, which serves as the data source for the articles.

Key Features:
Real-time News Fetching: Retrieves the latest news articles from multiple sources in real-time but it is dependent on the API key we used.

API Integration: Uses a News API key to fetch and display news content.

User-Friendly Interface: News articles are displayed in a clean and organized HTML format, making it easy for users to read through the latest headlines.

This project is designed to provide a simple yet effective way to stay updated with current events by aggregating news from various sources into one place. The code is modular and easy to extend, allowing for customization to include more features or different news sources.
